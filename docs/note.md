# RAPIDS
[rapid](https://rapids.ai/start.html)
[api docs](https://docs.rapids.ai/api)

1. 
    The RAPIDS data science framework includes a collection of libraries for executing end-to-end data science pipelines completely in the GPU

2.
   But there actually isn't anything new to learn. All the API (commands) for Pandas work with RAPIDS cuDF and all the API (commands) for Scikit-Learn work with RAPIDS cuML. These RAPIDS libraries cuDF and cuML are the accelerated versions of Pandas and Scikit-Learn respectively. They run on GPU (instead of CPU) and give you the same API as Pandas and Scikit-Learn, and they give 10x to 1000x speed up!

``` The best way to find out is to try it.- ```
